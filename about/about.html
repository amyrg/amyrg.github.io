          Hi! my name is Amy Grundleger, I was born and raised in Toronto, Canada and now attend the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida.
      Growing up in a big city gave me the opportunity to see many pro teams play in my home city, and from a young age I began to love pro sports and the world that surrounds them. I also realized in high school I had a love for writing and would basically live in my English teachers' office, perfecting my essays and articles.
    Going to school in Miami gives the opportunity to not just follow our Hurricanes and other ACC teams, but also follow the many pro sporting teams that play right in our backyard.
  This has made me want to make my own website to promote articles I have written about all kinds of sports, and I hope one day I can work in the sports world. </p>
