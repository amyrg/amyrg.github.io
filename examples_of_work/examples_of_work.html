        <p><a>  Whether it’s the smoke they ran through, the swagger they invented, or the five national championships they won (we all know it should be six); the University of Miami has a football legacy unlike any other. And for the recent history that’s just what it’s felt like: a legacy, a distant memory of Sun Tan U, that people tell stories about that start with “remember when…”

However, two years under the wings of Coach Mark Richt, the team has started to tell a different tale. With last night’s 41-8 win against #3 seed Notre Dame, the Miami Hurricanes are definitely up to something, but they aren’t “back”, and never will be.

Instead, the 2017 Miami Hurricanes are a different beast. We’ll never have Michael Irvin’s high step celebration, or a win in the Orange Bowl. But these Hurricanes are creating their own story, and if you can’t keep up, shut up. The team has already proven to be great with a 9-0 undefeated season, a #2 rank in the AP polls (yea, we want Bama), and the Hurricanes most loved piece of equipment this season: The Turnover Chain.

          <h2>The Era of Great (and absolutely awful NBA Superteams)</h2>

              <p><a> Just yesterday five years ago, Lebron James won his first ever championship. He didn’t do it alone, and he didn’t do it on his hometown team. He did do it in Miami with two other prominent players (Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh), and a cast built around those three players. Many fans and players (*cough* Draymond Green *cough*) believe that this was the modern start of the NBA Superteams. However, these strong Superteams are so simple to construct they almost happen by accident. When a team has a starting five and you replace a player with an All-Star, the effect can be predicted by a toddler, much less a General Manager.

The Superteam trend is alive and well in 2017, but debatably goes back to the 1960’s, with Wilt Chamberlain scoring an iconic 100 point game in 1962 (no one has ever matched this.) However, this phenomenon is most recognized in recent NBA history by Lebron’s move to Miami in 2010, again with his move to Cleveland in 2014, and then last season Kevin Durant moving to the Warriors for his first championship and their 5th.

Whether built at once like the 2007-2008 Boston Celtics or piece by piece like the current Warriors, the NBA has always and will always experience the power of Superteams. <a href="https://grundlegersports.com/2017/06/22/the-era-of-the-great-and-absolutely-awful-nba-superteams/">To read more</a></p>
